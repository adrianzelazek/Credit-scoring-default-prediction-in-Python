# Credit Scoring - default prediction among credit card holders in Python
### Author: Adrian Å»elazek

In this project was used dataset which contains 30000 observations as well as 24 variables. The main target of this project was to build predictive medels to determine the Probability of Default (PD) of clients hold credit card. This project can be called Credit Scoring, although this case is slightly different from the classic definition. To predict the targer variable 3 Logistic Regression models have been built.

The project includes Exploratory Data Analysis, grouping, visualization, splitting the training and testing data, tuning of hyperparameters by GridSearchCV method, predictions as well as Model Evaluation. Furthermore, results of training and test datasets were compared with each other to exclude possible of overfitting. 

This project was developed for the purpose of practicing machine learning and data mining in Python.
##### It is preferred to run/view the project via Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), sometimes it is required to press "Reload" to load the file, than via a browser (HTML). To see the HTML version you first need to download the HTML file and then run it in your browser.
